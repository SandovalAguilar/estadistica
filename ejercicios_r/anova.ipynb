    "1. A consultant was called to assist the police department of a large metropolitan city in evaluating its human relations course for new officers. He planned a two-factor factorial experiment where the treatments were A—the type beat to which officers were assigned, and B—the length of the human relations course. A sample of 45 new officers was chosen, and 5 were randomly assigned to each of the 9 treatment combinations. A test was developed to measure officers’ attitude toward minority groups and was administered to the participating officers after their training had ended and they had experienced two weeks on their beat. Better attitudes result in higher scores on this test. Analysis of the data revealed a significant A×B interaction effect between the type beat and length of human relations course."
